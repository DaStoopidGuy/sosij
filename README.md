![Sosij_1_1746681480221](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6043bb37-f7a0-4e9a-8c72-995a734d1cbc)

the best programming language on Earf  
also I am an ogre (^^)  

## UH.. the language.. spec?
> Work in progress, coming soon... >:3  

- strongly typed language
- `let` is to declare variable (type inference)
    - `<type-name>` can also be specified instead of `let` keyword  

## Quickstart  
To compile and run the demo compiler:  
```shell
    $ gcc bob.c -o bob
    $ ./bob run
```

It will also run `build/sosijc` along with assembling and linking the `out.s` output of `sosijc`  
which will produce `out` executable  
Now, run:  
```shell
    $ ./out
```


# TODO
- [x] get simple hello world program working  
    ```
    print("Hello World");
    ```
